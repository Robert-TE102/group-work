## Our User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to enter my name, and carbon footprint stats into a form.
2. As a user I want to be able to select options and not have to do any maths.
3. As a user the options I want to be able to enter are going to be usage for:
    - fuel and electricity.
    - type of transport.
    - type of diet (meat, vegetarian, vegan, local produce, supermarket)
    - flying hours I have per year.
4. As a user, I want to be able to compare my results against others.
5. As a user, I want my experience to be as simple as possible.
6. As a user, I want to see instant results.

## Our Requirements
1. A simple user form.
    - Type of fuel for heating.
    - Usage.
    - Usage for electricity.
    - Main form of transport.
    - Miles.
    - Annual flying hours.
2. A local test server.
3. A database.
4. A cloud production server.
5. A function that saves total carbon footprint into the database.
6. A webpage that refreshes after form submission.

## Given Project Requirements
1. Structured HTML & CSS
    - We have structured and semantic HTML and CSS.
    - We have used CSS commenting to create sections and have used pseudo-classes.
2. Attractive, Effective UI
    - We have a responsive UI and a layout that suits an easy to use UX.
    - We have a chart that updates with user inputs, and shows user information upon mouse hover over data points.
3. Javascript functions
    - Our inputs are selected upon input and tab use. Our submit button functions in a non-default manner as set out in our js logic.
    - Our functionality is excellent, performing mathematical functions within if statements, and pushing the result to the database and the HTML element carrying the latest result fo the users to see for them alongside the preveous entries.
4. DOM Manipulations
    - We render elements such as a chart and result element in response to user input.
5. Javascript logic
    - We appropriately use conditional statements, a for loop, arrays and objects to manage our data needs.
    - We import chart.js as a third party library.
6. API & Database
    - We pass data from the front end to the database and back again using fetch, and GET and POST endpoints.
7. Git & Version Control    
    - We used a shared repo, we worked in branches, we used pull requests to merge to main.
    - We resolved conflicts manually with only one merge with conflicts that went wrong. The rest were resolved manually successfully.
8. Project Management
    - We have written our user stories and requirements above this section. We have written our problem domain in the problem domain task on trello. We have our wireframe drawing on trello and had daily standups with focus on the blocks.
    - Our trello kanban and daily standups were critical to our project organisation, with the kanban stemming from our user stories.
9. Presenting
    - We used slides to present.
10. Collaboration
    - We completed tasks as agreed and had names against tasks on our kanban board. We used pair programming, and shared progress as we went. We ensured we had breaks when we wanted/needed to. We did not have any conflict but our plan for conflict was to remain professional and reassess the plan and go with group majority for any decisions needed during conflict.
    - We remained flexible during programming and so sometimes switched between single and pair programming when needed.
